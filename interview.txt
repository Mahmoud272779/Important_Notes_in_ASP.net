name , gradute from ,live ain shams , was interted in college in AI /ML especially my gradution project was in ml ,AI ,
 from month 8 : 1 track Backend with nodejs , .net   


AI--> any technique enabling computers to mimic the human intelligence using logic , if then rules 

ML--> subset of AI using statistical methods to do tasks (give it features and it will give you the classification)

DL--> subset of ml (feature extraction and classification) 
      need big data , high computional power , so use it in complex problems
      neural networks


classifcation --> predict label 
regression--> quatity


types of classifiers --> minimum distace(average) , nn , knn, Bayes classifiier , AdaBoost classifier combines weak (p= random gussing)
 to get strong , svm , decision tree

feature selection ---> from n features , choose subset of n 
feature extractiuon ---> transform n into L by transformation as PCA

curse of dim , overfitting

PCA   -->is to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional , 
choose  the directions that having the msot variance


NN --> like neurons in brain
